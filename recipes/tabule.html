   <h2><p>
    The most famous Arabic salad. Tabbouleh is delicious, fresh, and has something that no other salad has: LOTS OF PARSLEY.
</p></h2>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
   <ul>
    <li>1/2 cup of bulgur wheat</li>
    <li>2 tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 cucumber</li>
    <li>1/2 small onion</li>
    <li>1 large bunch of parsley (approx. 2 cups)</li>
    <li>1 small bunch of mint (approx. 1/4 of the parsley amount)</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Lemon</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Hydrate the Bulgur:</strong> Place the 1/2 cup of bulgur wheat in a bowl and cover it with cold water for about 10–15 minutes until it softens. Drain the excess water very well and set aside. *For best results, squeeze the bulgur to remove all water.*
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Chop the Vegetables:</strong> Finely chop the tomatoes, cucumber, and 1/2 small onion. Set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Chop the Herbs:</strong> Wash and dry the large bunch of parsley and the small bunch of mint thoroughly. Finely chop both herbs. The parsley should be very abundant.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Combine:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the drained bulgur, chopped vegetables (tomatoes, cucumber, and onion), and the chopped herbs (parsley and mint).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Dress the Salad:</strong> Add salt to taste, the juice of one or two lemons (to taste), and a generous drizzle of olive oil.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Mix and Chill:</strong> Mix all ingredients gently until well combined. Cover the bowl and let the tabbouleh chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Serve:</strong> Taste and adjust seasoning (more salt or lemon juice, if needed) before serving cold.
    </li>
